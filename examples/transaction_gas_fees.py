"""
Gas is the unit of measurement for the computational effort required to execute a transaction or contract on the 
Ethereum blockchain. Every operation in a smart contract requires a certain amount of gas, as it is the cost of 
computational resources for processing the logic within a transaction. Depending on ethereum blockchain traffic and 
network congestion, baseFeePerGas can fluctuate.
